**Data mining/Data Analysis with code**

The main purpose of this project performs the data mining, including data analysis, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and visualization, using as many data sets as possible. I absolutely and truly believe that this practice will help us to build more insights and experiences in data. 
Because in reality, we have encountered diverse problems and data sets and sometimes, we might be in panic and practice helps us a lot. Also, data mining is basically important to move forward to modeling. Here, we are going to analyze datasets, find patterns, and describe results with various perspectives and domain knowledge, if possible. 

If you feel like it, you should try it just for fun. It will be super-duper fun time :o)

**Modeling is NOT goint to be covered here. If you feel interested in modeling, check out my other project,[MD_w_code](https://github.com/soyounson/ML_w_code).**

#### â˜» Prerequisites
Please check environments and requirements before you start to run our sample codes. If required, we recommend you to either upgrade versions or install them for smooth running.
